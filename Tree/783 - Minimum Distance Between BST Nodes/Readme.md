Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

 

Example 1:

<img width="292" height="301" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c37d390b-5dfd-42ed-95da-d087c1b89157" />

Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]

Output: 1

Example 2:

<img width="282" height="301" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71df0d12-ad4b-4274-a84f-8b4e21501b57" />

Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]

Output: 1
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 100].

0 <= Node.val <= 105
