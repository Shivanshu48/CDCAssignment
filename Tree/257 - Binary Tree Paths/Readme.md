Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A leaf is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:

<img width="207" height="293" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d73d4d4c-859d-4718-8683-37153ea6dd9d" />

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]

Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]

Example 2:

Input: root = [1]

Output: ["1"]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100
