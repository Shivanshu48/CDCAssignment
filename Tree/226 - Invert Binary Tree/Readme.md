Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

 

Example 1:


<img width="911" height="301" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31ea7258-9ba8-4b8a-b656-4c53c9ab0975" />

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]

Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

Example 2:


<img width="761" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70dd91d2-9f33-4b86-a785-233e12ddfd87" />

Input: root = [2,1,3]

Output: [2,3,1]

Example 3:

Input: root = []

Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100
