Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 

Example 1:

<img width="622" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/916ae556-3a30-40c6-a363-be7728a4b3c9" />

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]

Output: true

Example 2:

<img width="382" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48d63bbb-14fe-4e2c-8f4a-5a033bcedc2c" />

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]

Output: false

Example 3:

<img width="622" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d19092c-edbf-4318-b7c2-e8278b539001" />

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]

Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].

-104 <= Node.val <= 104
