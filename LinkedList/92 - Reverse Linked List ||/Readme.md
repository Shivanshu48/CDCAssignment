Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

 

Example 1:

<img width="542" height="222" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f1b1de-67ae-4ff5-94b4-edfb0b82fd30" />

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4

Output: [1,4,3,2,5]

Example 2:

Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1

Output: [5]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is n.

1 <= n <= 500

-500 <= Node.val <= 500

1 <= left <= right <= n
